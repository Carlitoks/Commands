# Commands for docker

##  Uninstall old versions
Older versions of Docker were called `docker` or `docker-engine`. If these are installed, uninstall them:

``` $ apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io ```
## Install using the repository
Before you install Docker CE for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

### SET UP THE REPOSITORY
1. Update the `apt` package index:

``` $ apt update ```

2. Install packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS:

``` 
$ apt -y install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg2 \
    software-properties-common
```
3. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

``` $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add - ```

Verify that you now have the key with the fingerprint `9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88`, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint.
```
$ apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

pub   4096R/0EBFCD88 2017-02-22
      Key fingerprint = 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
uid                  Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
sub   4096R/F273FCD8 2017-02-22
```
4. Use the following command to set up the *stable* repository. You always need the *stable* repository, even if you want to install builds from the edge or test repositories as well. To add the edge or test repository, add the word `edge` or `test` (or both) after the word `stable` in the commands below.

To also add the *edge* repository, add `edge` after `stable` on the last line of the command.

```
$ add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

Note: Starting with Docker 17.06, stable releases are also pushed to the edge and test repositories.

### INSTALL DOCKER CE

1. Update the apt package index.

```
$ apt update
```

2. Install the latest version of Docker CE, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

```
$ apt install docker-ce
```

3. To install a specific version of Docker CE, list the available versions in the repo, then select and install:
   a. List the versions available in your repo:

$ apt-cache madison docker-ce

docker-ce | 18.03.0~ce-0~debian | https://download.docker.com/linux/debian jessie/stable amd64 Packages
b. Install a specific version by its fully qualified package name, which is the package name (docker-ce) plus the version string (2nd column) up to the first hyphen, separated by an equals sign (=), for example, docker-ce=18.03.0.ce.

$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION_STRING>
The Docker daemon starts automatically.

Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

x86_64:

$ sudo docker run hello-world
armhf:

$ sudo docker run armhf/hello-world
This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

Docker CE is installed and running. The docker group is created but no users are added to it. You need to use sudo to run Docker commands. Continue to Linux postinstall to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps. For Raspbian, you can optionally install Docker Compose for Raspbian.
